Audio::Radio::Sirius - Control a Sirius satellite radio tuner

Sirius satellite radio (http://www.sirius.com) is a US based satellite radio serice. 
While none of the tuners they make have serial or USB connectors, it has been found that 
generation 2.5 tuners (Sportster, Starmate, * Replay, Sirius Connect, and others) have a 
common tuner module. Furthermore this tuner module generally has a serial interface.

Once your tuner is connected to your system and accessible via a serial port like device, you can 
use this module to access it:

  use Audio::Radio::Sirius;
  use Win32::SerialPort; # or Device::SerialPort on Linux

  my $serial = new Win32::SerialPort('com1');
  my $tuner = new Audio::Radio::Sirius;

  $tuner->connect($serial);
  $tuner->power(1);
  $tuner->channel(184); # tune in the preview channel

This alpha release is not feature complete.  Please expect (possibly code breaking) changes.
