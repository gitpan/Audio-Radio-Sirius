Revision history for Audio-Radio-Sirius

0.02	04-November-2005 11:03 PM
	Implemented $tuner->set_callback.  Notification is now provided for channel updates.
	More callbacks to come.

	New internal read routine.  This (along with a changed monitor method) pretty much
	eliminated the duplicate updates from the tuner.  They have to be ack'd quick.
	The monitor routine now spins 20 times per second (although the parameter is still in
	seconds).  The effect on CPU utilization seems negligible.

	Tests added for a few items.

	New internal read routine should actually work on Linux systems, unlike the old scheme.

	Build file now builds Makefile.PL as well for legacy CPAN compatibility.
